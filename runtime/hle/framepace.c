// Frame pacing: the game's speed doesn't depend on the frame rate.
// The game advances its world each frame by its frame period (16.67 ms) times the swap interval its frame timer
// (f_700000c910) reads from the system object - normally 1. When a frame takes longer than a vsync (GPU-bound at
// 32:9, a hitch), the next frame starts a vsync later but still advanced only 16.67 ms: slow motion (30 fps = half
// speed). tools/patches.py FRAME_STEPS_SITE routes that read here: we return how many vsyncs really passed since
// the last frame, so the world advances by the time that passed. The game's own waiting is unaffected (it reads
// the interval nowhere else). Shared by the macOS and Windows builds.
// FINDING (2026-10-09): forcing 2 steps did NOT change Link's walking speed - gameplay is a true fixed step per
// frame; this timer feeds something else. Kept for research, off by default.
//   LARECOMP_FRAMEPACE=1     hand the timer the vsyncs elapsed (default: the game's own value)
//   LARECOMP_FRAME_STEPS_MAX maximum steps per frame (default 4: after a long stall the game doesn't jump ahead)
//   LARECOMP_FORCE_STEPS=<n> (test) always n
